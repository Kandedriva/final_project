# `Dream Job - Your Job Search and Recruitment Platform`

Welcome to Dream Job, a React-based single-page website designed to help job seekers find their dream jobs and recruiters post job openings. This README.md provides an overview of the project, how to use it, the technologies used, and how to contribute.

## `Project Description`

Dream Job is a user-friendly platform where job seekers can explore various job listings from different companies. Each job listing includes detailed descriptions and essential information. Users can apply for jobs, visit the company websites for additional information, and follow companies to receive notifications about new job openings. If you're a recruiter, you can also post job positions to attract top talent.

## `Usage`

    User [Registration/Login] : To access Dream Job's features, you must be a registered user. The Welcome page prompts you to either log in if you already have an account or create one if you're new to Dream Job. Without logging in, you won't be able to access any of Dream Job's features.

## `Browsing Job Listings`:

     Once logged in, you can browse the list of available jobs. To apply for a job, simply click the Apply button, which will take you to the application form. Please ensure you provide accurate and truthful information, as your application will be evaluated based on the details you provide.

## `Recruiter Features`:

     If you're a recruiter, you'll find a "Open a Position" section where you can create a job listing. Provide all the necessary details about the job, and after submission, you can view the newly created job on the available jobs page.
