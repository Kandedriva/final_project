# `Dream Job - Your Job Search and Recruitment Platform`
Welcome to Dream Job, a React-based single-page website designed to help job seekers find their dream jobs and recruiters post job openings. This README.md provides an overview of the project, how to use it, the technologies used, and how to contribute.

## `Project Description`
Dream Job is a user-friendly platform where job seekers can explore various job listings from different companies. Each job listing includes detailed descriptions and essential information. Users can apply for jobs, visit the company websites for additional information, and follow companies to receive notifications about new job openings. If you're a recruiter, you can also post job positions to attract top talent.

## `Usage`
	User [Registration/Login] : To access Dream Job's features, you must be a registered user. The Welcome page prompts you to either log in if you already have an account or create one if you're new to Dream Job. Without logging in, you won't be able to access any of Dream Job's features.
    
	User Dashboard: After creating an account, you'll be redirected to the login page. Use the email and password you provided during registration to log in.

 ## `Browsing Job Listings`: 
     Once logged in, you can browse the list of available jobs. To apply for a job, simply click the Apply button, which will take you to the application form. Please ensure you provide accurate and truthful information, as your application will be evaluated based on the details you provide.
    
	Application Status: After submitting your application, you'll be redirected to a page where you can track all the jobs you've applied for.

## `Recruiter Features`:
     If you're a recruiter, you'll find a "Open a Position" section where you can create a job listing. Provide all the necessary details about the job, and after submission, you can view the newly created job on the available jobs page.

## `Navigation`:
 Use the navigation bar to seamlessly navigate between different sections of the website.
	Logging Out: When you log out, you'll be taken back to the welcome page.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
